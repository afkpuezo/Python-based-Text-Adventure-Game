# Python-based-Text-Adventure-Game
A little text-based adventure game I worked on, developed in Python. I made use of the pygame library for rendering the text to the screen.
It's essentially one room with a few puzzles in it. I was definitely ambitious in terms of how many moving parts there are in the design of the puzzle, but
I believe I did a good job coding a flexible system that could easily support a wide variety of content.

  - Python
